You cannot really compare what is seen here on a tiny computer/phone screen to actually being surrounded by a sky full of stars in real life.\n\nStill, [This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/wiUpN4R.jpg) I took last year in the Adirondacks which I tried to edit to represent how we see the night sky. Although it is not *perfectly* processed for how we see the night sky, I think it does a reasonable job of visually demonstrating what the bulk of the differences are. The Milky Way appears as a cluster of mystical clouds cluttered with stars spanning the sky. You cannot quite make out the specific details and nebulae, but you will see it and know exactly what you are looking at when you do.\n\nWith that all said, go out to a [dark sky near you](https://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.html#4/39.00/-98.00) in the summertime and experience the awe inspiring Milky Way for yourself!\n\nThis image is a 6 image stack, consisting of 5 images with a star tracker and 1 untracked image for the foreground. All shots were taken consecutively one after the next.\n\nI used my h-alpha modified Nikon Z6 and Sigma 20mm f/1.4 ART to take this shot. I took five tracked shots for the stars at f/2.8, ISO 800, and 2 minutes each. After the tracked sequence finished, I took another shot to capture the detail on the landscape at f/1.8, ISO 800, 4 minutes with the camera still on the tracker but not actually tracking. I did initial adjustments in LR on each image, then sent the foreground into PS and the star stack into StarryLandscapeStacker. I stacked the 5 images using the Min Horizon Noise algorithm with a mask for the sky and exported the resulting file as a TIF. Then, I redid the stacking algorithm but with a mask for the lake. I brought the star layer into Pixinsight where I performed adjustments to reduce the noise, some stars, as well as bring out more data in the Milky Way Core. After this, I brought the output file into Photoshop where I stitched it together with the foreground untracked shot and lake stacked layer manually. I used masking to correct for a small discrepancy between the layers while performing additional adjustments to my liking to yield this final result.\n\nIf you have any questions about this shot, astrophotography, or astronomy in the Adirondacks in general, feel free to ask below!",
